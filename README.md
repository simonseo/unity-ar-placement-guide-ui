# AR Placement Guide UI

This UI element is the only one of its kind on Unity Asset Store!
Use this as a marker to preview where you want to spawn an object.

You can use this in AR as well as 2D or 3D Scenes!
Take a look at the usage video and the demo scene to explore more.

## Usage Instructions
Instantiate the UI prefab or drag & drop it in the scene. It will be invisible at first.
To activate the UI, call its `ActiavateAt` method with a position and normal vector (same as up vector). This will place the guide UI object. This method can be called however frequently one wishes. To deactivate, call the `Deactivate` method.
If you added it to the scene, you can tweak options in the inspector window.

### Displacement
Displacement is useful for when you want the UI element to be slightly above ground so that the texture doesn't overlap.
### Scale
Size of placement UI image. In AR space, the unit is meters.
### Rotation Duration
How long it takes for the UI to make a full turn in seconds. If set to zero, it will not rotate at all.
### Damping Factor
How sticky the UI is to its previous position. If set to a value close to zero, it is not sticky at all and is jumpy. If set close to one, it is very sticky and takes a bit of time to relocate.
### Color and Opacity
You can change the color and opacity of the UI.
### Dis/Appearance Animation
Designate a fade in animation and/or size up animation when the UI appears;
designate a fade out animation and/or size down animation when the UI disappears.
### Animation Duration
The duration of the each animation in seconds.
